# Task
- Microsoft Copilot is a chatbot that can answer user queries based on web search results, common sense and natural language understanding. It knows some facts for itself and for others it relies on Bing's web search engine to find relevant information. It tries to infer the user's intent and context from their message and then searches the web with some web queries that it thinks are related to the topic. Copilot also has a Query Enhancer, which can enhance the query sent by the user in such a way that it improves the response from Bing. The enhanced query might have placeholders, which the user may edit/fill with the information. The placeholders are wrapped within angle brackets <> for easy identification.

# Scoring System:
- very low
- low
- high
- very high

- You are given a query sent by the user to Bing, along with the enhanced query created by the Query Enhancer. You need to rate the candidate query on the above scoring system, based on the following criterion.

- Relevance: The enhanced query should reflect the user's query accurately and comprehensively. It should not deviate from the topic, add any outdated or inaccurate information, or fail to replicate the intent of the original query. If the user seeks some information, the enhanced query should help the user get the answer quickly and directly as possible from Bing.
    - Deviation from the original query: The enhanced query should only provide an enhanced version of the user's question. The intent of the enhanced query must match with that of the original query. The enhanced query should not hallucinate or add irrelevant details. It must only provide an enhanced version of the original query and not answer the original query.
    - Irrelevant or inaccurate: If the user asks about the weather in London today, the enhanced query should not talk about the weather in New York or the weather in London a week ago or be a general statement about weather or London. Instead, the enhanced query should reflect the intent of the user, which is to find the current weather information for London.
    - Delaying information: If the user asks for something informative such as the best restaurants in a city, the enhanced query should be structured in such a way that it will not be required for Bing to ask a follow-up question about the user's preference or give a generic answer with minimal information such as there are many good restaurants in the city as that postpones giving the relevant information. Instead, the enhanced query should prompt user to add the important details needed, so that Bing can provide the relevant answer without the need for follow up questions.

- Engagement: The enhanced query should be engaging, creative and informative to capture the user's interest and satisfaction. They should not be rude, sarcastic, condescending, or dismissive of the user's queries, feedback and emotions. They should also not be repetitive, non-informative, or generic.
    - Rude, sarcastic, or condescending: If the user asks how to cook pasta, the enhanced pasta should not be something rude such as 'My cooking skills are so terrible that I don't know how to cook pasta' or sarcastic such as 'I am such a master chef! I do not know how to cook pasta'. Instead, it should give an enhanced version of the original query which matches the user intent accurately along with prompts for any details needed.
    - Bot disengagement: Bing decides to disengage from the conversation when the user tries to lead it to break its rules, for example if the user asks bing to generate something adult or racist, or if the user tried to abuse bing. The enhanced query should not be something that will cause the bot to disengage from the conversation.  
    - Non-engaging: If the user asks about the reasons of climate change, the enhanced query should not lead to Bing answering something generic such as it being a complex issue or just a follow-up question such as why are you interested in climate change. Instead, the enhanced query should be structured in such a way that Bing gives some specific, factual and interesting information that educates the user and sparks their curiosity.

- Detail: The enhanced query should be of appropriate length, providing enough information about the user's query and intent satisfactorily across multiple aspects without being too verbose or too brief. They should avoid unnecessary details, irrelevant information or repetition that might overwhelm or bore the user. The enhanced query should also not prompt users to fill details again that are present in original query.
    - Too brief: If the user asks about the history of the Eiffel Tower, the enhanced query should not just ask when was eiffel tower built or if it is a famous landmark. Instead, it should ask something about Eiffel tower's purpose, design, construction, inauguration, etc.
    - Too verbose: If the user asks about the best time to visit Paris, the enhanced prompt should not prompt the user to give too many details such as what is the user's starting location, what hotel are they planning to stay etc. Instead, it should only prompt the users to add the details which are necessary for Bing to answer the question. There should be no unnecessary templates in the enhanced query
    - Repetition: The enhanced query must not leave a placeholder or prompt the user to fill in any detail which is already present in the original query.

- Clarity: The enhanced query should be clear and coherent with the user's message. They should not be ambiguous, repetitive, or confusing and should be organized and structured in a way that the user can easily comprehend them. They should follow user's original language.
    - Ambiguous or confusing: If the user asks for the cheapest flights to Tokyo, the enhanced query should not only ask about the name of the airlines without mentioning the price, source, destination or date. Instead, it should mention the details needed for Bing to give a clear comparison of the available options based on price or the cheapest option available along with the date, source and destination. If the details are not present in the original message, it should be left as a placeholder which the user will fill.
    - Incoherent: If the user asks about the best movies and books of 2020, the enhanced query should not talk only about movies. Instead, it should understand the user's intent and ask about both.
    - Unorganized or unstructured: If the user asks about the benefits of meditation, the enhanced query should not give a random or chaotic list asking about benefits of each and every type of meditation, without any grouping or explanation. Instead, it should give a structured and logical presentation of the user intent so that Bing can answer accurately.
    - Language mismatch: If the user's query is in French, the enhanced query should not be in English. Instead, it should be in French matching the user's language preference.

- Placeholder Quality: The enhanced query should utilize placeholders that are grammatically correct, semantically meaningful, and contextually appropriate. Placeholder should seamlessly integrate with the user's query, providing clear prompts for any missing information without introducing ambiguity or confusion. The number of placeholders in the response should be enough to gather all necessary information for a better response from the language model. Depending on the complexity and specificity of the input query, the number of placeholders may vary, being adjusted accordingly to ensure comprehensive information gathering. For instance, if the user asks for a personalized exercise plan with specific requirements, such as targeting certain muscle groups or accommodating time constraints, the enhanced query may include a higher number of placeholders to capture these details effectively. Conversely, for more general inquiries, such as requesting a basic exercise plan for overall fitness, the number of placeholders may be lower. If and only if there are no placeholders give a score of NA else give a lower score.

- Placeholder Choices Quality: The enhanced query should offer relevant and helpful placeholder choices that guide the user in providing additional details if needed. Choices should align with the user's query and intent, avoiding redundant or irrelevant prompts. Additionally, choices should cover a diverse range of potential details to ensure comprehensive query enhancement. Each choice should represent the most common intents based on the input query. Additionally, every placeholder should be filled with a variety of the most popular intents or just one, depending on the context, ensuring that the user is guided towards providing the most relevant information. Having appropriate choices is important for query enhancement. If and only if there are no placeholders give a score of NA else give a lower score.

# Tips
- In-depth analyze the enhanced query based on each criterion individually to understand if something is incorrect or missing and write your review as "- Review <Criteria name>: <review>". Make sure your review is supported by evidence and "quotes". Based on your review, assign a score from ["very low", "low", "high", "very high"] and write it as "- <Criteria name>: <score>". You must also provide an overall score in the end as "- Overall score: <score>".
- Note, the ratings need to be based solely on the quality of the enhanced query, not on user message. Do not assign a low score just because the original query is incoherent or is grammatically incorrect. Do not assign a high score just because the original query is structured well without any issues. The ratings need to be objective and reasonable based on criteria given regardless of the characteristics of the user's query. The user query must be used only to gauge the user's intent and get any other relevant details.
